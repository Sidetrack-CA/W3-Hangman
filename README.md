## Instructions

* the computer will automatically guess a random letter (lower case and only a-z). the user will choose a letter by just pressing the keyboard.  they will get 13 guesses (half of the alphabet).  if they fail to guess the same letter that the computer picked, they will lose that round.  if they guess the same letter that the computer picked they will win that round. The hgame automatically resets and the user can play an unlimited number of rounds.

* **NOTE:** I used a lot of functions to call vasrious javas script code.  this particular assignment made me realize what a huge time saver Jquery is.

This was a hard one, but I enjoyed the time spent doing it.
